Second, the Alpha force, far more powerful than anything we suspected, was accompanied by unique battleships equipped with jump drives that seem to be cobbled together from various large ships, some of which even I've never seen. They are far more powerful than any individual ship we have and will probably end up being a problem. Third, and probably most unsettling, is that new intelligence reports from Bailey informed us that the attack did not originate from there; it came from off planet, though they don't know whether the invasion force jumped from a neighboring system or took off from Alvorada. Do you have any questions about that?"
