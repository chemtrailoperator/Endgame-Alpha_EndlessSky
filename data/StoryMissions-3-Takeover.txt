			`The "Joint Headquarters" appears to be staffed mostly by the Republic, probably becaues the Free Worlds does not yet have the capability to deploy on such a scale. You are ushered past a line of waiting staff officers into the main office, where Raven, several Republic admirals, Free Worlds officers, and officials are seated.`
			`	One of the admirals begins speaking: "I've got several disturbing pieces of information for you, first, the defense in Men collapsed under another wave of attacks shortly after you left, and we are being pressured rather hard here now so for now Beta Lupi is off limits as well. Second, the Alpha force, far more powerful than anything we suspected, was accompanied by unique battleships equipped with jump drives that seem to be cobbled together from various large ships, some of which even I've never seen. They are far more powerful than any individual ship we have and will probably end up being a problem. Third, and probably most unsettling, is that new intelligence reports from Bailey informed us that the attack did not originate from there; it came from off planet, though they don't know whether the invasion force jumped from a neighboring system or took off from Alvorada. Do you have any questions about that?"

Since it is beyond the purview of Navy regulations, I will not force you, but you are the most likely candidate."`
