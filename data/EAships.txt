	description "Though the Navy often uses drones, fighters, and capital ships at a distance, the withering fire of a flight of Hailstorms can be very destructive. It should be noted that in order to fit the massive launchers needed, the designers at the Geminus Navy Yard sacrificed the powerplant and ECM suite."

	description "Although some military leaders consider it prohibitively expensive, a fleet of Heavy Auxiliaries can not only carry enough personnel and materials to fill a small planet, but it can protect them effectively on the way there."
	description "The modular design of the Auxiliary allowed the spine to be extended to accomodate more container units. This makes the hull proportionally more expensive, plus the cost of the high quality containers and fighter bays."

	description "On its own, this ship is relatively useless. The light armament and hull construction are not anywhere near sufficient for the duties that a Frigate would usually take. As part of a larger fleet, however, it is incredibly useful. It carries the most advanced sensor suite and computing system used by the Navy, and its speed and maneuverability allow it to provide ECM for larger ships."
