	description `This is a pristine and perfectly habitable world, with warm oceans and a temperate climate. The land is dominated by large reptiles similar to the dinosaurs that roamed the continents of ancient Earth. Some of the land reptiles are over twenty meters in length, and the sea holds monsters more than twice that size.`
	description `	Deep in the jungles near the equator, small mammals are working hard to avoid being eaten by the great lizards, and to survive for long enough that they will be able to evolve into the dominant life form.`
