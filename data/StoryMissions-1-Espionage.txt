The short of it is that a large celebration was abruptly cut short by an impressively large amount of explosives set off by what were simple unaffiliated terrorists on the surface, but ended up being a part of an intricate web of terrorists that linked together a few small incidents. The group hasn't ever done something of this magnitude though."`
