We couldn't ever repeat it after the first batch, it seems there was some unnoticed errors in the genes that hadn't been documented. The Deltas were weaker than the Alphas, still much stronger than a normal human though, and they grew slower, but the point is that they were extremely intelligent. Out of the original 25 embryos, 14 survived to be born and by the time they were two they were talking in complicated sentences and we estimated that none of them had an IQ below 200. Sadly, or maybe fortunately, they all eventually died without reaching adulthood and we weren't able to replicate it again though we tried very hard. Most importantly they seemed to have at least some of the empathy and ability to love that wasn't present in the Alphas. Years later we were able to make a few Betas but they weren't nearly as intelligent, I believe you've met one, Elias Hanover, he lives with the Quarg now and last I heard he was doing very well and he-- but I digress, it could be very bad indeed if the Alphas or humans in league with them are able to breed more Deltas to use in the war or cross with Alphas to remove what shreds of humanity they have left.

			`	"Good news, commander," says Alzaga,  "the parliament navy recruitment committee gave us remarkably little trouble about getting you into the Navy permanently, meaning that you are now a Navy officer. We don’t have any work for you right now in regards to the Alpha affair, we hope Greenrock was just a small enclave and will investigate the Starstreak. In the meantime you will be able to serve as an officer by commanding small patrols. We do ask that in these patrols you use a Frigate as a flagship so as not to raise questions. Incidentally you already qualify for some awards due to your service against the Pug, so you might see some notifications in the future."`
			`	"I would also recommend buying a uniform and your insignia at the outfitter here on Earth. It will authorize you to wear any awards you receive and will make things look a little more official for us and a little less awkward for you. You'll see the uniform available to you in the outfitter within a few days, so be sure to stop by and check."`
