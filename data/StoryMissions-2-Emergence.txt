We couldn't ever repeat it after the first batch, it seems there was some unnoticed errors in the genes that hadn't been documented. The Deltas were weaker than the Alphas, still much stronger than a normal human though, and they grew slower, but the point is that they were extremely intelligent. Out of the original 25 embryos, 14 survived to be born and by the time they were two they were talking in complicated sentences and we estimated that none of them had an IQ below 200. Sadly, or maybe fortunately, they all eventually died without reaching adulthood and we weren't able to replicate it again though we tried very hard. Most importantly they seemed to have at least some of the empathy and ability to love that wasn't present in the Alphas. Years later we were able to make a few Betas but they weren't nearly as intelligent, I believe you've met one, Elias Hanover, he lives with the Quarg now and last I heard he was doing very well and he-- but I digress, it could be very bad indeed if the Alphas or humans in league with them are able to breed more Deltas to use in the war or cross with Alphas to remove what shreds of humanity they have left.
