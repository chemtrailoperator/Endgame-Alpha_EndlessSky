This plugin is currently known to work for Endless Sky version 0.10.10 or later.

This plugin allows you to serve in the Navy and earn the Navy licenses that are currently in-game and unobtainable, and it will also add general content and other things we thought would be nice in the game.

Make sure you create a game save at the start of the story, the storyline is currently incomplete and many worlds will become inaccesible permanently.
