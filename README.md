This plugin is compatible with Endless Sky v0.10.14.

This plugin allows you to serve in the Navy and earn the Navy licenses that are currently in-game and unobtainable, and it will also add general content and other things we thought would be nice in the game.

Make sure you create a game save at the start of the story, the storyline is currently incomplete and many worlds will become inaccesible permanently.
      
The storyline is activated by a low frequency spaceport mission on any Free Worlds planet, and requires completion of the FW storyline.

Coming Soon:
Full synopsis in the wiki
More storyline
Possible linking with some other of my plugin repos
