This plugin requires Endless Sky v0.10.16.

This plugin allows you to serve in the Navy and earn the Navy licenses that are currently in-game and unobtainable, and it will also add general content and other things we thought would be nice in the game.

Make sure you create a game save at the start of the story, the storyline is currently incomplete and many worlds will become inaccesible permanently.
      
The storyline is activated by a low frequency spaceport mission on any Free Worlds planet, and requires completion of the FW storyline.

The code is available in release 0.5, however, it is not updated, so download a ZIP directly from the code to get the most recent version. Everything should be stable.

Coming Soon:
More storyline and general additions
Possible linking the wiki with some of my other plugin repos
