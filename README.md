This plugin requires Endless Sky v0.10.16.

This plugin allows you to serve in the Navy and earn the Navy licenses that are currently in-game and unobtainable, and it will also add general content and other things we thought would be nice in the game.

Make sure you create a game save at the start of the story, the storyline is currently incomplete and many worlds will become inaccesible permanently.
      
The storyline is activated by a low frequency spaceport mission on any Free Worlds planet, and requires completion of the FW storyline.

If you want to download the code, download directly from the repo for now until version 1 is published.

Coming Soon:
Full synopsis in the wiki
More storyline
Possible linking with some other of my plugin repos
